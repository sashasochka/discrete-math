========================================
1) Max flow algorithm (Floyd-Fulkerson method, Edmonds-Karp algorithm):

Max flow value is 5.0

Flow on each edge: 
	for edge (0, 1) flow is 3.0
	for edge (0, 2) flow is 2.0
	for edge (1, 3) flow is 3.0
	for edge (2, 4) flow is 2.0
	for edge (3, 4) flow is 1.0
	for edge (3, 5) flow is 2.0
	for edge (4, 5) flow is 3.0

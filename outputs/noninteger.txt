========================================
1) Max flow algorithm (Floyd-Fulkerson method, Edmonds-Karp algorithm):

Max flow value is 20000.7

Flow on each edge: 
	for edge (0, 1) flow is 10000.0
	for edge (0, 2) flow is 0.7
	for edge (0, 4) flow is 10000.0
	for edge (1, 5) flow is 10000.0
	for edge (2, 3) flow is 0.7
	for edge (3, 5) flow is 0.7
	for edge (4, 5) flow is 10000.0

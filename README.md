Discrete math homework
================================

This repository consists of lab assignments for 2nd cemester discrete structures class in my university (National Technical University of Ukraine "Kyiv Politechnical Institute") 
This course consists of the following elements of graph theory:
 - shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Johnson)
 - bfs/dfs
 - different graph representations (adjacency lists, adjacency matrix)
 - NP-hard problems (graph coloring)
 - other stuff (graph planarity checking)

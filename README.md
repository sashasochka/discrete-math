Discrete math homework
================================

This repository consists of lab works for 1st grade discrete structures class lab in my university (National Technical University of Ukraine "Kyiv Politechnical Institute") 
This course consists of the following elements of graph theory:
 - shortest path algorithms
 - bfs/dfs
 - different graph representations
 - NP-hard problems
 - other stuff

### For my groupmates
If you are my coursemate - don't use this code or use it with caution! You are warned.

But read it as much as you want - ask me for questions if you need
